## GradeVault Weight System

GradeVault uses a configurable weight system to calculate grades from detected defects. The system starts at 10.0 and subtracts points based on defects found.

### Base Formula

```
Final Grade = 10.0 - Σ(Defect Deduction × Region Weight)
Minimum Grade = 0.5
```

### Region Weights

Different areas of a comic affect the grade differently:

| Region | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Spine** | 1.5x | Most visible, structural integrity |
| **Top Left Corner** | 1.2x | High visibility area |
| **Top Right Corner** | 1.2x | High visibility area |
| **Bottom Left Corner** | 1.2x | Common handling wear point |
| **Bottom Right Corner** | 1.2x | Common handling wear point |
| **Surface (Center)** | 1.0x | Less critical but affects eye appeal |

---

## Defect Deductions

Each defect type has a base point deduction. The actual deduction is multiplied by the region weight where the defect is found.

### Structural Defects (Severe)

| Defect | Base Deduction | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Missing Piece** | -5.0 | Paper missing from cover/pages |
| **Detached Cover** | -4.0 | Cover separated from staples |
| **Spine Split** | -3.0 | Spine paper separating |
| **Tear (Major)** | -2.5 | Tear > 1/2" in length |

### Structural Defects (Moderate)

| Defect | Base Deduction | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Spine Roll** | -1.5 | Spine curves outward |
| **Staple Rust** | -1.5 | Oxidation on staples |
| **Tear (Minor)** | -1.0 | Tear < 1/4" in length |

### Surface Defects

| Defect | Base Deduction | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Color Touch** | -2.0 | Restoration/touch-up detected |
| **Stain** | -1.0 | Visible staining |
| **Foxing** | -0.8 | Age spots/oxidation spots |
| **Fingerprints** | -0.3 | Visible oil marks |

### Wear Defects

| Defect | Base Deduction | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Color Break** | -0.5 | Crease that breaks ink |
| **Crease (Minor)** | -0.4 | Light crease, no color break |
| **Corner Blunting** | -0.3 | Rounded corners |
| **Spine Stress** | -0.3 | Light stress marks |

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Near Mint Copy
- Detected: Light corner blunting (TL), Spine stress
- Calculation:
  - Corner blunting: 0.3 × 1.2 = 0.36
  - Spine stress: 0.3 × 1.5 = 0.45
  - Total deduction: 0.81
- **Final Grade: 9.2 (Near Mint-)**

### Example 2: Fine Copy
- Detected: Spine roll, Minor tear (surface), 2× Corner blunting
- Calculation:
  - Spine roll: 1.5 × 1.5 = 2.25
  - Minor tear: 1.0 × 1.0 = 1.00
  - Corner blunting (×2): 0.3 × 1.2 × 2 = 0.72
  - Total deduction: 3.97
- **Final Grade: 6.0 (Fine)**

### Example 3: Good Copy
- Detected: Staple rust, Spine split, Stain, Heavy corner damage
- Calculation:
  - Staple rust: 1.5 × 1.5 = 2.25
  - Spine split: 3.0 × 1.5 = 4.50
  - Stain: 1.0 × 1.0 = 1.00
  - Heavy corner: 2.0 × 1.2 = 2.40
  - Total deduction: 10.15 (capped)
- **Final Grade: 0.5 (Poor)** - Would be negative, capped at minimum

## Adjusting the System

GradeVault's weight system is configurable. To adjust:

1. **Defect Deductions**: Modify `lib/grading-config.ts` → `DEFECT_DEDUCTIONS`
2. **Region Weights**: Modify `lib/grading-config.ts` → `REGION_WEIGHTS`
3. **Grade Thresholds**: Modify `lib/grade-adjustment.ts`

### Recommended Adjustments

If grades seem **too harsh**:
- Reduce structural defect deductions by 10-20%
- Lower region weights to 1.0-1.3x

If grades seem **too generous**:
- Increase wear defect deductions
- Raise spine weight to 1.8-2.0x
